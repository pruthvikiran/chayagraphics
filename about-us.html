					<h2>The Industry Scenario :</h2>
					<p class="lead">The Indian Health care industry, which has achieved the global recognition for world class health care at competitive rates, has strengthened its financial growth during the recent years. Patients from other countries are increasingly becoming medical tourists in India. Also various health insurance schemes are made available by major insurance companies, which have boosted the demand for quality / high standard healthcare service in India.</p>
					<p class="lead">It is in this healthcare industry that Chayagraphics Healthcare Pvt Ltd has established its business. CGHCPL as it’s popularly known was established in 1984 as a trading organization with focus on healthcare imaging. The main activity of the company is trading in the full range of Healthcare Imaging Products – right from equipment’s related to radiology to consumables, Infection control products, etc. The company is head quartered in Bangalore with branches in Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata. The company achieved good success due to its unique product range and established sales and service network of dealers/branches throughout the country. </p>
                    <p class="lead">The global spotlight is on the Indian hospitals and health care due to delivery of world class care at competitive rates. The main reason being the availability of lower treatment cost, expertise in technology and  qualitative human resource pool have put the domestic healthcare industry on the global map. With such significant advantages, India is slowly becoming the favorite destination for medical tourists, with the soaring cost of medical procedures in other parts of the world such as Middle East and the West. Recently, Government at the Centre has also initiated a slew of measures in promoting healthcare tourism in the country while the respective states are more focused on propagating health measures more particularly for the people below poverty line in villages, semi urban & urban areas. This has become a boon to the health care industry in general and the traders of health related products in particular keeping in mind the vast potential that is getting created</p>    
					<p class="lead">Today CGHCPL are the pioneers of trading business possessing thirty two plus years of rich domain experience. The company claims nation-wide sales, service and dealer network, established contacts with leading and premier hospitals across India both in government and private and an existing installed base of one thousand plus satisfied customers as a captive market for any new product. The company also boasts of physical infrastructure of high-end warehouses at prime locations.</p>
